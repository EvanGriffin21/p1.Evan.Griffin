Some issues with the current design is that the buttons are in rows with the basement and ground floor level labeled but if someone foreign is
unfamiliar with the B and G buttons they will be confused.


Common uses for elevator: Allowing people to travel to other floors without the use of stairs, great for transporting heavy things like luggage, groceries and laundry. 
Common sequence of action is pressing the outside panel then going into the elevator then pressing your destination floor on the panel in the elevator.
The elevator supports the user by the button that you pressed lighting up
The elevator may provide feed back by announcing the floor that the user is traveling too when they arrive.

Common mistakes pressing the wrong floor number, getting confused with the lettering of floor numbers for example where does B take me.
Some improvements I would make is making the floor buttons in a vertical line so the user can visualize where there are going.
